REVE 2016
4th International workshop on Reverse Variability Engineering
held in conjunction with SPLC2016 - 20th International Software Product Line Conference
September 19, 2016
Beijing, China

Introduction
*******************************
Software Product Line (SPL) migration remains a challenging endeavour. From organizational issues to purely technical challenges, there is a wide range of barriers that complicates SPL adoption. This workshop aims to foster research about making the most of the two main inputs for SPL migration: 1) domain knowledge and 2) legacy assets. Domain knowledge, usually implicit and spread across an organization, is key to define the SPL scope and to validate the variability model and its semantics. At the technical level, domain expertise is also needed to create or extract the reusable software components. Legacy assets can be, for instance, similar product variants (e.g. requirements, models, source code etc.) that were implemented using ad-hoc reuse techniques such as clone-and-own. More generally, the workshop REverse Variability Engineering (REVE) attracts researchers and practitioners contributing to processes, techniques, tools, or empirical studies related to the automatic, semi-automatic or manual extraction or refinement of SPL assets.

Goals
*******************************
- To provide a meeting point for researchers and practitioners in the area
- To review and formulate a research agenda in reverse engineering for variability
- To identify and gather a corpus of case studies and benchmarks to benefit the research and practitioner community

Workshop Topics
*******************************
We will encourage submissions that push the state of the art and practice in the following topics (but not limited to):
- Experience reports on SPL migration
- Organizational issues on SPL migration
- Static, dynamic or information retrieval techniques for legacy assets analysis
- Feature identification and location techniques
- Feature constraints discovery
- Feature model synthesis
- Extraction of reusable components
- Clone detection techniques
- Visualisation techniques during SPL migration
- Product Line Architecture reengineering
- Refactoring theories and techniques for SPLE
- Tacit knowledge and collaboration in SPL migration
- Mining variability from software repositories
- Literature reviews on reverse engineering in SPLE
- Metrics and measurements for SPL migration
- Case studies and benchmark examples
- Industrial experiences of SPL migration
- Tool support for SPL migration

Important dates

Submission details
*******************************
Submission types: Authors interested in participating in the workshop are requested to submit either:
- Regular paper (max. 8 pages) that presents original research or industrial experience report
- Short paper (4 pages) that describes sound new ideas and concepts that are under research or experimental studies at industrial settings.
Format: Submissions should use the ACM SIG proceedings format.
Submission: All papers submitted to the workshop must be unpublished original work and must not have been submitted anywhere else for publication. Each paper will be reviewed by three PC members and accepted papers will be selected based on quality, novelty, and relevance to the workshop topic. Papers should be submitted via http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=reve2016
REVE organizers are also promoting a post-workshop special issue about Reverse Variability Engineering. More news soon.
