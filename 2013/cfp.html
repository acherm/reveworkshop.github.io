REVE 2013 - 1st International workshop on Reverse Variability Engineering <br>
held in conjunction with CSMR2013 - 17th European Conference on Software Maintenance and Reengineering <br>
March 5–8, 2013, Genova, Italy <br>
<br>
http://www.sea.jku.at/reve2013/ <br>
<br>
Introduction <br>
******************************* <br>
Variability management of a product family is the core aspect of Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE). The adoption of an SPL approach requires a high upfront investment that will allow to automatically generate product instances based on customer needs. Mining existing assets could dramatically reduce the costs and risks of this adoption. Those existing assets use to be similar product variants that were implemented using ad-hoc reuse techniques such as copy-paste-modify. Bottom-up approaches to automatically extract variability management related artifacts could be proposed, applied, validated and improved in this domain. We propose this workshop to fill the gap between the Reengineering and SPLE communities. 
<br>
Goals <br>
******************************* <br>
-To provide a meeting point for researchers and practitioners in reverse engineering for variability. <br>
-To review and formulate a research agenda in reverse engineering for variability. <br>
-To identify and gather a corpus of case studies and benchmarks to benefit the research and practitioner community. <br>
<br>
Workshop Topics <br>
******************************* <br>
We will encourage submissions that push the state of the art and practice in the following topics (but not limited to): <br>
- Refactoring theories and techniques for SPLE <br>
- Feature and concept location techniques applied in the variability context <br>
- Clone detection techniques for identifying code and model similarities <br>
- Literature reviews on evolution and reverse engineering of software product lines <br>
- Case studies and benchmark examples for reverse engineering tools <br>
- Mining variability from software repositories <br>
- Program analysis for reverse variability engineering <br>
- Reverse engineering of feature models <br>
- Reverse engineering of derivation templates for code generation <br>
- Reverse engineering of variability management related enriched models for model instances derivation <br>
- Product Line Architecture reengineering <br>
- Tacit knowledge and collaboration during re-engineering process <br>
<br>
Important dates <br>
******************************* <br>
Paper submissions: Friday, January 11 <br>
Notification to authors: Friday, January 25 <br>
CSMR 2013 Early registration deadline: Monday, February 4 <br>
Camera-ready version: Friday, February 8 <br>
CSMR 2013 Conference: 5-8 March 2013 <br>
<br>
Submission details <br>
******************************* <br>
Submission types: Authors interested in participating in the workshop are requested to submit either: <br>
- Regular paper (max. 8 pages) that presents original research or industrial experience report <br>
- Short paper (4 pages) that describes sound new ideas and concepts that are under research or experimental studies at industrial settings. <br>
<br>
Format: Submissions should be formatted using the IEEE 8.5" x 11" two-column format. <br>
Templates for Word and LaTeX are available at http://www.computer.org/portal/web/cscps/formatting <br>
<br>
Submission: All papers submitted to the workshop must be unpublished original work and must not have been submitted anywhere else for publication. Each paper will be reviewed by three PC members and accepted papers will be selected based on quality, novelty, and relevance to the workshop topic. Papers should be submitted via http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=reve2013 <br>
<br>
Best artifact award: A special award will be conferred to the best artifact or tool submitted. The decision will be taken based on the paper reviews and the maturity and usability of the tools or case studies presented. The goal of this award is to promote and encourage the public disclosure of both tools and case studies for the common benefit of the research and practitioner community. <br>
<br>
Special issues: CSMR2013 post-workshops special issue with selected papers from each workshop is currently being considered. <br>
REVE2013 organizers are also promoting a post-workshop special issue about Reverse Variability Engineering. More news soon. <br>
